# Android app for PCON
We are planning to develop an Android Application for the Programming Club of NIT Jamshedpur (PCON) to help students get in touch with the club and its events.
Here is your chance to kill two birds with one stone. Oops! Here is your chance to feed two birds with one scone (political satire intended). You will learn to contribute to an open source project and help yourselves to become a great android app developer. So join us while we code.

## Communication
Our chat channel is on WhatsApp. Here is the [invite link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EtW5iphSMAFBLu8gYNFrRI)

## Setting up the Android Project

1. Download the project source. You can do this either by forking and cloning the repository (recommended if you plan on pushing changes) or by downloading it as a ZIP file and extracting it.

2. Open Android Studio

3. Open this project by clicking on Open, then navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository, select the root folder of the project, and hit OK. Android Studio should now begin building the project with Gradle.

4. Once this process is complete and Android Studio opens, check the Console for any build errors.

  - _Note:_ If you receive a Gradle sync error titled, "failed to find ...", you should click on the link below the error message (if available) that says _Install missing platform(s) and sync project_ and allow Android studio to fetch you what is missing.

5. Once all build errors have been resolved, you should be all set to build the app and test it.

6. To Build the app, go to _Build>Make Project_ (or alternatively press the Make Project icon in the toolbar).

7. If the app was built successfully, you can test it by running it on either a real device or an emulated one by going to _Run>Run 'app'_ or pressing the Run icon in the toolbar.

## Contributing
- Fork this repo
- Clone your forked repo
- Create a new PR with a feature you want to add (though this depends upon the discretion of the PCON App team) or fix a bug in an already existing feature
